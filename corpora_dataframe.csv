I consciously made use of the last four sounds, above, given how
often we spent the weeks of the course listening to and analysing
them.

Transformations
I used the following transformations on these samples throughout the song:

- STFT morph between piano-phrase.wav and vignesh.wav for the
  intro part, layering that with the original piano.wav for some
  extra piano quality.

- Harmonic-Plus-Stochastic model (HPS) frequency scaling
  transformation of vignesh.wav to make vignesh sing along with
  the gentle guitar loop.

- HPS frequency scaling transformation of flute-A4.wav to make a
  flute accompaniment to the gentle guitar loop.

- HPS frequency scaling and stretching transformation of speech fragment

Assembly
The results of these transformations were then cut up into sections,
duplicated and liberally sprinkled into a single mix using Audacity

Some effects were accomplished using the layering of different
sounds. For example, I layered the ""singing"" vignesh.wav sound I
created on top of the original sound to achieve a singing
chorus. Similarly with the speech fragment in the latter half of
the song.",332392,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/,ASPMA-assignment-10b.wav,./audio_corpora_freesound/332392_4792848-hq.ogg,Mouzzaka

A tip from me to you is cut the bassline in pieces, explore all the locations where you can use for start a song... use short parts of the bassline and use stretch and pitch techniques

Feel free to use this little soundscape however you like; cut it up, reverse bits, detune it, whack some strings over it, sing over it, completely mangle it up by running it through a bass distortion pedal so it sounds like a choir of musical bees... whatever floats your proverbial boat, just please make sure to credit me (Matt Campbell) and add a link to this page so others can find it.

I'd love to hear/ see what you do with this so please send me a message and let me know what you did with it! It makes me really happy to see my work inspiring other people.

I am still far from being a musician but I tried to emulate the kind of music I used to like. I combined three ""synthetic"" sounds I generated thanks to Audacity. First, a rhythm track made from a cow bell sound at a 184 bpm tempo and 6 pulses by beat. The pitch is pretty low to avoid to keep the bell sound. Then I added another low-pitch sinusoidal sound with a Paulstretch effet for the bass. And finally, I used a distortion effect ( hard overdrive) on a higher-pitch sound to get this result.
